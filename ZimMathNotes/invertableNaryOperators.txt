====== invertableNaryOperators ======
Created Wednesday 07 November 2018

Let {{./equation010.png?type=equation}} be the set of invertable functions {{./equation008.png?type=equation}} with n inputs on the set {{./equation007.png?type=equation}}.
{{./equation009.png?type=equation}} is the set of permutations on the set {{./equation007.png?type=equation}}.
For {{./equation011.png?type=equation}} and a permutation {{./equation012.png?type=equation}}, **p**ermuting the **p**ositions of the **i**nputs and **o**utput produces another invertable n-ary operator {{./equation015.png?type=equation}}:
{{./equation013.png?type=equation}}.
Composition of permutations applies: {{./equation014.png?type=equation}}.
For any fixed permutation, {{./equation016.png?type=equation}}.
Similarly, **p**ermuting the **v**alues of the **i**nputs and **o**utputs produces another invertable nary operator.
{{./equation017.png?type=equation}}
{{./equation018.png?type=equation}}
Composition of permutations applies: {{./equation020.png?type=equation}}
For any fixed tuple of permutations, {{./equation019.png?type=equation}}.
A generalization of function composition

===== Equivalence to permuted modular arithmetic =====
