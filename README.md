Plan 1: I decided to make this because of how nice the knowls are in PreTeXt HTML. Unfortunately, the HTML book is not properly viewable offline.

Plan 2: I planned to use Zim to create a wiki. I disliked that it made a new image file for each equation.

Plan 3: Write multiple LaTeX files which reference each other. They may also reference kig files or images for geometry.
